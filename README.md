# Alois Alzheimer Airport

Run the lost & found office at the Alois Alzheimer Airport. A game created for
the [Global Game Jam 2021](https://globalgamejam.org/2021).

## About the game
Find items lost by the visitors of the airport and return them before they are
lost forever. Ultimately, we couldn't dedicate as much time to making the game
as we would during a "physical" jam. The jam version is playable, but it is
missing important features and it doesn't feel as finished as we'd like.

Best played in full screen and with a controller. Use the left stick to move
around, and the main button to grab items.

## Running the game
This is a Unity game. You can build and run it on any supported operating
system, though we only really tested the web version. You can play the [WebGL
version of the game](https://trionteam.net/GGJ21/).
